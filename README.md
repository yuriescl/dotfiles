This repository contains a few of my personal dotfiles that I use in my day-to-day workflow.

- [bashrc.d](./bashrc.d): mainly utility functions and aliases
- [nvim](./nvim): my primary text editor, I use VSCode sometimes for previewing markdown, or when I'm sharing my screen (otherwise it's impossible for other people to track my Neovim navigation)
- [tmux](./tmux): a terminal multiplexer, I used it until some time ago but now I just use Gnome Terminal directly because the fonts look better
- [kitty](./kitty): a minimalist but modern terminal that supports font ligatures, which helps reading code better, I used it until some time ago but now I just use Gnome Terminal directly because the fonts look better

## What Linux distro do I use?

My history with Linux goes a long way back, started using Ubuntu in 2009, then went over dozens of distros including advanced ones like Gentoo and LFS. It was fun to keep switching but not productive for daily work, so I had to stop distro hopping.
The only thing that makes me format my PC nowadays is if the system gets broken by either disk corruption or after a big update. This is very rare, but sometimes happen, even on major "stable" distros, usually due to Kernel driver bugs. I had many issues with Acer laptops and Linux.
Tried to stay in Ubuntu, it broke, then Fedora, broke, then Debian, broke, then Arch Linux, then became very unproductive just by maintaining the system. Then finally settled Fedora in 2025.

My current distro is Fedora (vanilla). I like it because it has direct upstream support from RedHat, has bleeding edge packages, and never broke after an update (even distro version update). But I am not distro fanatic so I can switch if needed to whatever else.

## How my Neovim looks like

Font: Inconsolata Semi-Condensed  
Why? because it saves a lot of space horizontally, I can see more characters in the screen.
