This repository contains a few of my personal dotfiles that I use in my day-to-day workflow.

- [bashrc.d](./bashrc.d): mainly utility functions and aliases
- [nvim](./nvim): my primary text editor, I use VSCode sometimes for previewing markdown, or when I'm sharing my screen (otherwise it's impossible for other people to track my Neovim navigation)
- [tmux](./tmux): helps me manage terminal screens without leaving keyboard home row
- [kitty](./kitty): a minimalist but modern terminal that supports font ligatures, which helps reading code better
